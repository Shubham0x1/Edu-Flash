# LLM-Powered Flashcard Generator

A modern web application that generates interactive flashcards from educational content using Google Gemini AI. The app supports editing, translation, structure detection, and question searchâ€”all in a beautiful, user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Flashcard Generation:**
  - Uses Google Gemini (via the gemini-1.5-flash model) to generate high-quality flashcards from pasted text or uploaded PDF content.
- **Difficulty Levels:**
  - Each flashcard is tagged as Easy, Medium, or Hard.
- **Edit Before Export:**
  - Edit any flashcard (question, answer, difficulty, topic) in a smooth modal before exporting.
- **Multi-language Support:**
  - Instantly translate all flashcards to multiple languages (Hindi, Spanish, French, etc.) using Google Translate (via backend proxy).
- **Structure Detection:**
  - Automatically detects and groups flashcards by chapters, subheadings, or sections in your content.
- **Question Search:**
  - Type any question and get an answer from your pasted text or PDF using Gemini (even if the answer is not in a flashcard).
- **Export Options:**
  - Export flashcards as JSON, CSV, Anki, or TXT.
- **Responsive UI:**
  - Works beautifully on desktop and mobile.
